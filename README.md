__Record the Earth__

> Join researchers and be a citizen scientist. Record the sounds of the Earth.

Earth's sounds tell an amazing story. Each soundscape recording is a snapshot of a unique place and time. Record the Earth is a global citizen science initiative to record all of the sounds around the World. Join the mission and record the sounds around you then upload them to the Global Soundscapes Archive at the Purdue University Center for Global Soundscapes. Create a profile at www.recordtheearth.org where you can listen and explore all the sounds from around the world.	

__Citizen Science Research Participation__

Record the Earth is an application for global ecological data collection. You are collecting information about the health and well being of the planet through sound and helping researchers understand human's connection to soundscapes. What are sounds that you love, what are sounds that you hate. Which sounds could indicate a the arrival of a new season. Your mission is to go out and record the sounds around the earth, describe and tag them. Then sign up online to rate, share, sort, and explore the data being collected from around the world and save your favorites sounds to your own soundscape playlist.
